Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public License without this special exception.\n\nThis special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation in version 2.2 of Bison."
