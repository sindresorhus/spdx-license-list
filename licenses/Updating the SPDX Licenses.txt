Steps to update the SPDX License List on the spdx.org website:

1. 	Download the current version of the SPDX licenses into a local directory (if you already have a git clone on your local machine,
	that directory may be referenced).
2.	Create an output directory for the output files from the tool.  Note: do NOT create this output directory as a subdirectory of your
	local git repository - we don't want output files stored in the Git repo.
3.	Run the SPDX workgroup tool generateRdfaLicenses using the command: 
	java -jar spdx-tools.jar LicenseRDFAGenerator spreadsheet.xls outputDirectory [version] [releasedate]
	where spreadsheet.xls is the excel version of the SPDX license list downloaded in step 1 and outputDirectory is the path the the directory you 
	created in step 2.  If [version] and/or [releasedate] are specified, they will override the values in the spreadsheet (not reccomended).
4.	Review the console output for any errors - any slight variation in the spreadsheet columns will cause an error.
5.	Review the output in the created in the build output directory
6.	Create an archive file from the build folder named htmlfiles-vx.xx where x.xx is the version number of the license list.
7.	SFTP the archive file up to the Linux foundation server php1.linuxfoundation.org
8.	Log into the Linux Foundation server
9.	Create a new subdirectory in the ~/licenseArchive directory with the format mm-dd-yyyy where mm is the month, dd is the day, and yyyy 
	is the year the files were uploaded.
10.	Unarchive the uploaded file in the subdirectory created in step 9.
11.	Backup the current files by replacing the files in the ~/backup folder with the files in ~/www/spdx/content/licenses.
	IMPORTANT NOTE: Do NOT do a recursive copy, only copy the files and do NOT copy any subdirectories.
12.	Create a new subdirectory ~/www/spdx/content/licenses/archive/archived_ll_vx.xx where x.xx is the version of the PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED 
	license list being replaced.
13.	Copy the files from ~/backup to the subdirectory created in step 11
14.	Edit the file ~/www/spdx/content/licenses/archive/archived_ll_vx.xx/index.html.  Add the line
	"<p style="color: #FA0207;"><strong>THIS IS NOT THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE SPDX LICENSE LIST. PLEASE USE THE CURRENT VERSION, LOCATED AT: <a href="http://spdx.org/licenses/">http://spdx.org/licenses/</a></p>"
	immediately prior to the line "<h1>SPDX License List</h1>"
15.	Copy the files from the subdirectory created in steps 9 and 10 to ~/www/spdx/content/licenses
16.	In the web browser, clear the browser cache and test the licenses at http://spdx.org/licenses
17.	If there are any problems, copy the files from the backup back to ~/www/spdx/content/licenses
